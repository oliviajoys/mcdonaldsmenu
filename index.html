        <h2>Upcoming Menu Items</h2>

        <h3>Milkybar Raspberry Ripple & Munchies Cookie Dough McFlurry</h3>

        <p>McDonald’s and its love of introducing new McFlurries to their menu frequently is unreal. It is because people in the United Kingdom consider McFlurries as a daily part of their lives and they would eat it on a daily basis anyway.

            This is because McDonald’s keeps introducing these McFlurries time after time so that their loyal customers keep enjoying the taste of these delicious McFlurries.
            
            Now, on the 17th of July, McDonald’s will release two new McFlurries Milkybar Raspberry and Cookie Dough McFlurry.
            
            The Milkybar McFlurry will be prepared with the help of Ice Cream and it is sprinkled with Milkybar chocolate bites and raspberry sauce at the top to make it look delicious and presentable. 
            
            On the other hand, Muniches Cookies Dough McFlurry is prepared by McDonald’s by using the Munchies biscuit pieces, for the decoration and sweetening of the McFlurry Caramel cookie dough sauce is used at the top of this McFlurry. </p>
            
        <h3>Birthday Cake Donut</h3>

        <p>McDonald’s is also introducing a Birthday Cake donut to its menu for the 50th anniversary. It will be a casual but tasty ring donut sprinkled with items and filled with strawberry sauce inside it. We will have to wait and see for how much time this donut will remain on McDonald’s menu. </p>

        <h3>McCrispy BBQ Smokehouse, Double Big Mac & Double Big Mac with Bacon Burger</h3>

        <p>McDonald’s menu is not complete without burgers. On the 17th of July, they will add three more burgers to their menu:</p>

        </ul>

        <p>First of all, let's talk about the McCrispy BBQ Smokehouse burger. This is a burger made out of chicken and some other ingredients. It was discontinued by McDonald’s in October of 2023. Now, finally, it is making a comeback and people are getting excited to try it again.

Double Big Mac and Double Big Mac Burger with bacon are also coming to their menu. These are the iconic burgers of McDonald’s and people just love to have the jumbo-size of the burgers in their meals. </p>
